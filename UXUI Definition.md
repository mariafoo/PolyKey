# Polykey UX/UI Process

## Value Proposition

Polykey makes encryption possible for everyday people.

Encryption is a technical process and is currently impossible for many people. However, information security is becoming more important as people become aware of the real possibility of security hacks. 

As more and more information becomes digital, we want people to be able to protect and share their data securely with others as easily as running an app on your computer or mobile phone. 

Polykey is secure because your encrypted information is stored in your computer - not on the cloud (where it is managed by a third-party's server). 

## Key ideas

* Keynodes
* Vaults
* Symmetric key 
* Asymmetric keys (public key, private key)
* Keybase 
* GnuPG
* Passwords and Certificates/Files

## Platform 

* Browser 
* **Desktop** - since Polykey will be a distributed peer-to-peer system

## Main Interface

1. Make a Keynode
2. Make Vaults
3. Manage (add/remove/update) secrets
4. Retrieve secrets
5. Share Vaults 
    * history of keynodes you have shared to
    * find new keynodes
    * connect with Keybase
6. Manage active/inactive keynode sessions/instances

## UX/UI needs to be designed for:

### Adding Secrets

1. Step 1 (choose type of secret)
* Add Password 
* Add File

2. Step 2 (choose type of file secret)
* Add File/Add Certificates
* Add File/Add API/SSH Keys
* Add File/Media (e.g. photos, videos, recordings)

3. Step 3 (input metadata to be encrypted)
* Encrypt file by adding to Default Vault
* Give an option to delete the file from current location (or existing directory)
* What metadata does Polykey need? Can it be automatically generated through the file's metadata?
* Encrypted file may be generated in Default Vaults and then moved to other Vaults
* Vaults cannot be nested (for now)

## Next steps... 
* More storyboards needed (according to interface requirements)
* Design Polykey UX/UI
* Market survey
